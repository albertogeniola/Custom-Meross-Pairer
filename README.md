# Custom Pairer for Meross Devices
Hi there! If you came accross this repository it means you are looking for a way to 
take control over your Meross Hardware devices. Well, let me congratulate with you: that's 
exactly what made me start the journey to develop the MerossIot API, Homeassistant component,
Homeassitant addon and finally the Custom Pairer App.

## What's this?
This app, *Custom pairer for Meross Devices* is just a tool that is able to configure Meross 
Devices so that they connect to an arbitrary MQTT broker, rather than the official Meross one.

I probably don't need to explain why that is necessary: that's just the reason you are here 
after all. In any case, let me be crystal clear: if you are looking for an app to pair your 
meross smart devices to the official Meross cloud, then you *MUST* use the original Meross App.
(although this app is capable of doing so). 

You should use this app if trying to achieve one of the following goals:
- You want to pair your Meross Devices with [Homeassistant Meross Lan-Only Addon](https://github.com/albertogeniola/meross-homeassistant)
- You have your own MQTT broker and you know how [Meross protocol works](https://albertogeniola.github.io/MerossIot/meross-protocol.html#client-device-pairing).

# Call for testers!
The app is now accepting alpha/beta testers: if you are interested into that, please [visit
